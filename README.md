- `InvoiceForm` (view)
- `InvoicePresenter` (presenter)
- `InvoiceRepository` (data access)

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema (Manual Setup)

```sql
CREATE TABLE Invoices (
    InvoiceId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY,
    InvoiceNo BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    CustomerName NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    InvoiceDate DATETIME NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE InvoiceItems (
    InvoiceItemId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY,
    InvoiceId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Invoices(InvoiceId) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    Description NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Quantity INT NOT NULL,
    UnitPrice DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL
);
